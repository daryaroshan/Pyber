My Analysis

1.Rural Areas had less drivers and riders of Pyber ride sharing, but no well defined trend in relationship to average fare. 
  This could possibly be explained by varying distances of rides in rural areas or the supply of drivers in rural areas. 
  It doesn't seem to be the case that the number of drivers in rural areas correlates to average fare,
  but drivers in rural areas only make up 1% of the total drivers while rural areas account for roughly 6% of total fares and rides. 
  We also see data points for average fare well above what is experienced in the city.

2.In general, the number of drivers seems to increase with city classification with rural areas having the least amount of drivers per city and urban areas having more.
  There are, however, data points for urban areas that have similar nuber of drivers. 
  Perhaps a study of population or geographic size versus number of drivers would be beneficial in exploring this trend.

3.There seems to be a negative relationship between the number of rides and the average fare. 
  This is more well defined for the suburban and urban city classifications. 
  This might be explained by the supply of drivers or the average distance a rider is travelling in these cities. 
  Average travel distance might be wirth exploring further. 
  However, if you examine the pie chart, you can observe that cities make up for 63% and 68% of total fare and rides repectively, 
  but the number of drivers in the city is 86.2% of the total drivers. 
  It is possible that there is an over supply or drivers in these cities causing lower prices. 
  A similar, but less dramatic trend is seen with suburban areas. 
  Additionally, when examining the bubble chart for cities, cities with a smaller number of drivers do seem to have a higher average fare in general.
  This is trend is not as well defined with suburban areas. 
  Again, a comparision to of driver per capita may be helpful.
